        <h><b>The Entire Plot of Omori was much more revolved around a very different relationship between Sunny and Mari during development</b></h>

        <p1>It is not a particularly uncommon theory/indulged in fandom media that Mari was abusive/an abuser but ultimately not supported in-game. However, I don't believe it is that strange/uncommon to get that read from her before the end of the game occurs. I know I did have that as a theory of mine approaching the end of the game, but learning the truth that it was more a tragedy full of accidents it broke my heart.</p1>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p2>But...</p2>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p3>After going through COUNTLESS amounts of Omori pre-release content + unused content out of curiosity's sake, I believe that Omori went through a semi-significant rewrite for it's core idea and potentially could be a cause of why Omori had such an insane Dev Hell time frame.</p3>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p4>Mari may have in fact been a completely different character for most of Omori's existence as an idea.</p4>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p5>Mari may have in fact been the single focal abuser causing Sunny to become the depressed shut-in more consistent with Omoriboy and the original Omori comics.</p5>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p6>(I would like to note I do not for a second believe that this is reflected as dark subtext within the final game/Mari's final character. I am just analyzing how the story likely changed much like Omocat mentioned on Basil Birthday stream on 2/18/2022)</p6>
        <h2><b>Public Release Info</b></h2>
        <p1>Omori is somewhat notorious for how Omocat kept people in the dark for most of the game's development post being kickstarted but there is still a lot we can work with.</p1>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p2>The first thing I'd like to draw attention to is Mari's appearance in all pre-release Omori content.</p2>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p3><i>More specifically... the fact she only has one appearance across everything barring the late 2018 Kickstarter backer demo and the 2020 trailer right before the game was released.</i></p3>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p4>Mari is not in Headspace at all.</p4>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p5>She is not synonymous with Sunny's ideal world for most of the time the<i> idea Omori existed</i></p5>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p6><s>Ignoring Omoriboy because it's only Omoriboy in white space with Mewo (and maybe proto Abbi?), but he clearly is struggling with something</s></p6>

        <a href="https://www.omocat-blog.com/post/57264870461/omoriboy-omoris-story-omoris-sketchbook-omori">Omori comic?</a>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p7>The one that Omocat deliberately showed off and commented on with all its allusions to modern/later incarnations of things for Basil's Birthday Stream?</p7>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p8>Not one peep of her outside of saying they gave OG Beta Basil's (Flower) perfectionism to Mari.</p8>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p9>For emphasis, one of the final panels after Omori is whisked away from his imagination and his friends where he looks at his notebook and breaks down crying.</p9>

        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erzgjfU271g">2014 Kickstarter Trailer?</a>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p10>She only makes an appearance in white space for a brief second more haunting Omori. She is not animated along with his friends Aubrey/Kel/Hero. Even Basil gets one shot of animation turning around here in his headspace colors as well. Well outside of Something’s first appearance…</p10>
        <br>
        <br>
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nV0BST2nifk">2017 Trailer?</a>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p11>While double-checking this video, this is where my suspicions went from "Oh perhaps this is just keeping up the mystery" to "Oh my god, she's not here still".</p11>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p12>Because the single most synonymous thing with Mari in headspace (and arguably the whole game) is being at picnics with the cast.</p12>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p13>However, there is a picnic scene on screen with finished/current animations for Aubrey and Kel (Hero is squinting his eyes but same pose, and Omori is in his sitting position but eating the fruit) and specifically no Mari to be seen. In fact, this headspace emphasized trailer has her not appear at all.</p13>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p14><i>Edit I completely forgot about 2018 demo, that is the first appearance of headspace Mari minimal impact on game however she has a weird in-between state of being near picnics but they're never called her picnic baskets</i></p14>
        <h3><b>Unused and Older Game build info</b></h3>
        <p1>There is certainly a lot less info here relative to what I have typed up here. Though there are some KEY dialog differences that are to my knowledge completely unused in the final game of Omori but still reported on the Omori text dump database.</p1>
        <br>
        <br>
        <a href="https://goats.dev/omori/maptext.html#farawaytown_extras_fears">You can find the following quotes I post under this exact link. The named character is something, which is very clearly Mari.</a>
        <ul>
            <li>Oh, little brother... Please do not resist... After all I've done for you... Will you not trust me? Please... Let me take care of you...</li>
            <li>Sweet, little brother... You... You are confused... Why do you deny my help? I will always want the best for you... You know that, don't you? Please... Let me take care of you...</li>
            <li>I'm sorry... Sweet little brother... I must insist... Your eyes... They are welled with tears and your fingers...\ They shake in pain. Do not worry, little brother. I will take care of you...</li>
            <li>Sweet little brother. It is time to rest... Shut your eyes... and stay very, very still...</li>
        </ul>
        <p2>You are then given the prompt to answer yes or no to these... requests. With the game responding with these respectively.</p2>
        <ul>
            <li>You feel something crawling up your leg.</li>
            <li>You feel something crawling up your neck.</li>
        </ul>
        <p3>This by itself is incredibly creepy and unnerving without much explanation.</p3>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p4>However, please allow me to put on my tinfoil hat for a second I had a thought while double-checking the Kickstarter trailer of Omori for this post. I noticed the first appearance of something is followed by the reflection of it within Omori's eyes. That is then quickly followed up with a reflection of what later is known as a red hand in Omori's eye then swimming by an intentionally very vague outline of an image. The hand is not outlined with red for what it is worth but it is [Something] then a hand. Very loose connection to say the least but something to ponder.</p4>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p5>I almost don't want to supplant what the image right at the frames the hand is moving at and would like if people could find their own interpretation but I honestly see someone sitting on another's lap</p5>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p6>Also gonna comment on 2019 build info.</p6>
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuBci-5r5K4">tldr, a lot of 2019 August stuff found in version 1.0 on steam buried away with a lot of things similar to the final game.</a>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p7>Headspace Mari is here and present in some picnics but not most. She is very much in the photos implied by the game and mostly seems helpful. (Plus helping with debug aspects but so is Basil handing out blackspace letters lol)</p7>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p8>However, I would like to emphasize that a lot of creepy Mari elements that are fully implemented into the game.</p8>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p9>Including the honestly most creepy and cryptic of all known as Mari is Home. Which apparently can be accessed on Alt route which is thought-provoking, to say the least. The fact that maybe the most horrifying of which is still around could say that creepy Mari was a definite focus that existed in the game potentially longer than wholesome headspace Mari.</p9>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p10>tl;dr</p10>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p11>While none of this is particularly concrete information for what might have been, I think all together this paints a very consistent and elaborate picture that the Mari that we know and love today is not the Mari that was around for most of Omori’s life.</p11>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p12>Thanks for taking the time to read this borderline ramble/excuse from being productive and let me know your thoughts!</p12>
