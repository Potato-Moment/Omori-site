        <p1>Hey,</p1>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p2>I just almost finished the Humphrey segment and there was something I noticed. So I asked myself the question: What if Molly's and Marina's sister dynamics actually triggered Omori/Sunny?</p2>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p3>When entering Molly's lab, there was a huge bomb which would presumably kill Marina and probably that's the thing that triggered Omori's/Sunny's past trauma so that's why he decided to solve all the puzzles in order to spare Marina. Also, you remembered Kel saying, Molly wouldn't kill her own sister, but the rest wasn't so sure about it. That might be an indication that Sunny wouldn't do such a thing either, at least not on purpose.</p3>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p4>Besides, keep in mind that the party is slowly forgetting about Basil and they must now be really deep in Headspace. Probably, parts of Black Space which is connected with the truth are now beginning to leak through and that includes Molly's and Marina's sister dynamics that might result into Molly accidently killing Marina if the party didn't solve all the puzzles.</p4>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p5>Btw. try taking the last two letters out of Marina's name. That might make everything clear now.</p5>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p6>But that's just a theory....A GAAAAAME- nevermind, that guy is really unpopular in the Omori fandom ðŸ˜…</p6>
