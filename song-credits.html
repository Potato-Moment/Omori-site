        <p>So in the sunny route there are 2 endings, in the bad one omori taking control over you and making you oyasumi yourself of the building. In the good one defeating omori and moving on. You see, the end credits of the bad ending are sung by bo en, which probably is omori. The good ending credits is without vocals, because there is no omori to sing the song, this time you, the player, sing the end credits.</p>
