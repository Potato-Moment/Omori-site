        <p1>Do you think the "microwaved" meat Sunny ate in three days left was actually uncooked, and the microwave functioning was just sunny hallucinating/hazy perception from being hungry and sleepy? Because if you notice (from what I remember) the fridge was not lit up like it's supposed to be, so maybe the microwave wasn't actually functioning and sunny ate straight up uncooked meat? (Explaining why he threw up after)</p1>

        <p2>This is actually kinda silly and unimportant but yeah</p2>
